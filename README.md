# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Scikit
 This code demonstrates how to train a house price prediction model using regression algorithms, save the model and preprocessor (scaler and encoder) using pickle, and load them later for making predictions. It enables efficient model reuse without retraining, ensuring a smooth prediction process.
